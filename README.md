# MiniProject-Web-Scrapping-of-e-newspaper-for-visually-Impaired-
Making readability of e-newspaper easier for visually Impaired
ABSTRACT
Now a day’s world relied on Digitalization of everything. Because of digitalization everything is easier. So, I have to design the News Paper Web Scrapping System which is beneficial for the visually impaired people. This System will ask from the user to input the URL of the web page of newspaper website. It will do scrapping and converting the content in audio format.
This makes visually challenged person easier to get the information easily from the newspaper website and and this model is also effective for other website also.
This project proposes a system to make the readability easier for the visually challenged person in simple and effective manner.


INTRODUCTION
    E-Newspaper Web Scrapping System For Visually Impaired
It is an expert system which is used for simplifying the task of Visually Challenged. It is a system which takes the url of web page as input. It will check that paticular web page and scrap the various text content and trim it.  It saved the trim data and converted into speech. This system not only simplifies the newspaper readability issue but also helps the visually challenged by helping them for many more website like book reading and blogs reading. 
So, earlier visually challenged person have to face many difficulties will reading the content on any particular website. Many screen reader software is available in advance but they don’t have feature of filtering the content and displaying it as an user favorable way.
This, E-newspaper scrapping system provides the flexibility to the user in this case. By doing all like scrapping, trimming and reading type of things. And last it will convert this scrapped material into the speech.
